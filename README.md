# Deep Probabilistic Accelerated Evaluation (Deep-PrAE)
Our work presents an efficient rare event simulation methodology for black box autonomy using Importance Sampling.

The preprint paper can be accessed in [Deep-PrAE arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.15722)

The 2-dimensional example illustrated in the paper and the self-driving example will be available here shortly.
